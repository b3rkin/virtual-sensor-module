# The Project:
This project is a c++ program that takes position (x,y,z) and orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) data and turns it into realistic accelerometer and gyroscope data.

## Current status of the project:
The program iterates through the datapoints from the input csv and calculates the accelerometer and gyroscope values without any noise. After each calculation it inserts the sensor output to the output csv (With just the linear acceleration values). The program assumes that the inertial measurement unit (IMU) is placed exactly in the center of the object it is attached to.

## Setup
1. Run the included "compile_virtual_sensor_program.sh" script in the root of the directory to compile the virtual sensor module:
   - ./ compile_virtual_sensor_program.sh 
2. Run the program from the directory root:
   -  ./virtual_sensor_program

## I/O

| Input       | Output |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A (.csv) file with orientation and position.     | A (.csv) file with accelerometer and gyroscope values.       |
| input.csv: x,y,z,roll,pitch,yaw,timestamp  | output.csv: aX,aY,aZ,gX,gY,gZ,timestamp |

## Units
The units used are compliant with the larger project this virtual IMU is part of.
| Value               | Units used in Project         |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| roll, pitch, yaw    | degrees (o)                   |
| pX, pY, pZ          | meters (m)                    |
| accX, accY, accZ    | g (1g = 9.81 m/s^2)           |
| gyroX, gyroY, gyroZ | degrees per seconds (dps)     |
| timestamp           | micro seconds (Î¼s)            |
