# The Project:
This project is a c++ program that takes position (x,y,z) and orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) data and turns it into realistic accelerometer and gyroscope data.

## Current status of the project:
The program iterates through the datapoints from the input csv and calculates the linear acceleration in the cardinal directions. After each calculation it inserts the sensor output to the output csv (With just the linear acceleration values).

## I/O

| Input      | Output |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A (.csv) file with orientation and position.     | A (.csv) file with accelerometer and gyroscope values.       |
| input.csv: x,y,z,roll,pitch,yaw,timestamp  | output.csv: aX,aY,aZ,gX,gY,gZ,timestamp |

## Units
The units used are compliant with the larger project this virtual IMU is part of.
| Value               | Units used in Project         |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| roll, pitch, yaw    | degrees (o)                   |
| pX, pY, pZ          | meters (m)                    |
| accX, accY, accZ    | g (1g = 9.81 m/s^2)           |
| gyroX, gyroY, gyroZ | degrees per seconds (dps) |
| timestamp | micro seconds (Î¼s) |

## The coordinate system

## TO-DO
 - [ ] Add the conversion from tracking points (position[pX,pY,pZ] + orientation[roll, pitch, yaw]) to sensor values(accelerometer[accX, accY, accZ] + gyroscope[gyroX, gyroY, gyroZ]).
    - [ ] Calculating the angular velocity from derivation of roll, pitch, yaw values. 
    - [x] Calculation of acceleration in the x,y,z directions using double derivation of position values.
    - [ ] Conversion from linear acceleration calculation to accX, accY, accZ wit the rotation matrix.
    - [ ] Conversion of the gravity vector to propper accX, accY, accZ with the rotation matrix.
    - [ ] Addition of gravity to the obtained accX, accY, accZ values.
 - [ ] Add realistic noise to the obtained sensor values.
